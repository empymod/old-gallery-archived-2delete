Magnetic fields and magnetic permeability
=========================================

The main implementation of ``emg3d`` obtains the electric field due to an
electric source. However, ``emg3d`` can also be used to model a magnetic
source, obtain the magnetic field, or any combination thereof (:math:`ee`,
:math:`em`, :math:`me`, :math:`mm`).
